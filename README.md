## 🧾 About

This project is a side-scrolling platformer game created using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. It's one of my earlier projects that helped me understand the basics of game development, collision detection, movement logic, and level design.

I also created the background music using my own music production skills to give the game a custom vibe.

- Handling movement and collision using JS
- Using arrays for level structure and object placement
- Custom music integration
- Game logic fundamentals and debugging with the console
- Understanding variable scope and code organization in interactive projects
