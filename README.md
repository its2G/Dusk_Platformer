## 👨‍💻 About

This was one of the first projects I created back in my first year — a 2D platformer game where I focused on both gameplay mechanics and sound design. I added a sky-level parkour challenge on the left side of the map where the player has to make their way to the flagpole, and I produced the in-game soundtrack myself using my background in music production.

## 🎮 Features

- 🎵 **Original Music**: The soundtrack was produced from scratch using my own skills in music production.
- 🪜 **Sky Platforming Section**: A vertical parkour level that requires precision movement to reach the final flagpole.
- 🧱 **Map Design**: Built using arrays to efficiently draw and manage multiple objects around the map.

## 💡 What I Learned

This project helped me get hands-on with programming logic and game mechanics in a way that made sense. Here's what stood out for me:

- **Conditionals**: I really started to understand how "if this, then that" logic applies to gameplay (e.g., jumping, collisions).
- **Arrays for Visual Layout**: Using arrays made it much easier to build levels and spread visuals across the screen.
- **Organising Code**: Learned quickly how messy things can get if the code isn’t structured well — keeping things tidy helped a lot with debugging.
- **Working with Shapes**: I got confident creating visual objects using basic shapes. I could picture something in my head and break it down into shapes in code.
- **Game Logic Fundamentals**: I began to see how much detail goes into even simple game mechanics.
- **Debugging with Console**: The console became my best friend for spotting mistakes and solving problems.
- **Global vs Local Variables**: This project helped me get my head around variable scope and how to apply it when building game features.

## 📌 Final Thoughts

This project gave me a lot of confidence with both code and creativity. It showed me how much thought goes into the small things that make a game actually feel playable. Looking back, it's cool to see how far I’ve come — and how this was the foundation that kicked everything off.
